<<<SEQUENCE 0>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Binky needs to get
his act togther!
Put in some effort
once in a while!

<<<SEQUENCE 1>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Whenever I see
her, I get the
urge to keep her
safe...

<<<SEQUENCE 2>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Why is she always
so pushy with me?
I wish we could
just get along.

<<<SEQUENCE 3>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
How is he so
laid-back? I
can't make heads
or tails of him.

<<<SEQUENCE 4>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Her attitude is a
complete mystery.
Is she...into me?
I can't tell.

<<<SEQUENCE 5>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Cueball is an
upstanding lady.
I can let my guard
down around her.

<<<SEQUENCE 6>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Eh, whatever.
Time for some fun,
boyos!

<<<SEQUENCE 7>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Binky is cute and
bouncy! I think of
him as my lil' bro.

<<<SEQUENCE 8>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Clara is every-
one's beloved idol.
She's even got
me intrigued...

<<<SEQUENCE 9>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Sweet lil' Petunia
is as cute as a
button. And I think
she likes me!

<<<SEQUENCE 10>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Max, you've lived
a cushy life. You
know nothing about
the outside world.

<<<SEQUENCE 11>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Don't be fooled by
that sweet voice of
hers. She'll ruin
you!

<<<SEQUENCE 12>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
We may come from
different worlds,
but I can make you
a better woman.

<<<SEQUENCE 13>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
I don't want to
settle down, but
if Clara was with
me, then...

<<<SEQUENCE 14>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Max is such a cool
cat. I wish I could
be a little more
like him.

<<<SEQUENCE 15>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Playing with
Twizzler is so
much fun! He
can do anything!

<<<SEQUENCE 16>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Graymer has been
following me around
lately. I wonder
why?

<<<SEQUENCE 17>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
She acts like a
big deal even
though she's
smaller than me!

<<<SEQUENCE 18>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Cheese Puff is a
tall drink of water!
I want to see his
passionate side.

<<<SEQUENCE 19>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
How can you be so
oblivious! Umm, I'm
right here!
Hello??? Hmph!

<<<SEQUENCE 20>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
A girl born with a
silver spoon is so
much fun to tease.
Tee hee hee...

<<<SEQUENCE 21>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Max treats us all
very kindly. He's
like everyone's
big brother.

<<<SEQUENCE 22>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
I don't think I'm
smart enough to
keep up with his
conversations...

<<<SEQUENCE 23>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Graymer has
smarts while still 
being sexy. I'm
jealous of her.

<<<SEQUENCE 24>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
He's gentle and
kind with everyone.
I wish he'd save
it just for me!

<<<SEQUENCE 25>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
I prefer cats with
some intelligence.
I'm not sure
he's the one...

<<<SEQUENCE 26>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
She talks a big
game, but at heart
she's still a little
girl.

<<<SEQUENCE 27>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Twizzler is so
immature! His puns
make me gag!

<<<SEQUENCE 28>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
You're older than
I am, so act like
it!

<<<SEQUENCE 29>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
All Clara does is
nag, nag, nag! Her
ladylike appear-
ance is all an act!

<<<SEQUENCE 30>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Why's he always
flipping out!?
But I sense he's a
nice guy at heart.

<<<SEQUENCE 31>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
He's cool, but I
can sense some
ulterior motive.
Danger, danger!

<<<SEQUENCE 32>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Everyone badmouths
him, but I bet he's
actually a softie.

<<<SEQUENCE 33>>> StartPoint=(6,6) Keeps=[0]
Sprocket has a
dangerous air about
him. Us ladies need
to take care.
